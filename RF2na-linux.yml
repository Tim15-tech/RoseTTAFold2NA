# Important: run_RF2NA.sh activates RF2NA upon calling
# Therefore don't use another name than below or adjust reverse in run_RF2NA.sh
# Also run it out of the base-env and not the already activated RF2NA:
# Conda is initialised and then RF2NA activated. Double activation leads to problems
# This script works for rna-protein, dna-protein has issues correlating or uncorrelating
# for the rest please follow the normal installation, like for the SE3-Transformer
